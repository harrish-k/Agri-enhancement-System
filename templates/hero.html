    <h2>What Is Soil Testing?</h2>
    <p>
      It is the farmland analysis for multiple parameters like chemical
      content, toxicity, pH level, salinity, earth-dwelling biota, etc. Such
      tests also provide information on chemical contamination, humic or
      organic content, electric conductivity, cation exchange capacity, and
      other physical and chemical properties.
    </p>

    <h2>Types Of Soil Tests</h2>
    <p>
      The analysis type depends on the explored components or properties of
      the field ground that may beneficially or adversely impact crop
      development. The most frequently-used types analyze and measure:
    </p>
    <ul class="lists">
      <li>mineral content,</li>
      <li>pH level,</li>
      <li>soil moisture,</li>
      <li>salinity,</li>
      <li>pesticides and chemical contamination,</li>
      <li>structure and texture, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Soil Nutrient Testing</h2>
    <p>
      Valuable information on nutrients content allows accurate
      fertilization to support plant needs within precision agriculture
      implementations. This is why the chemical test for soil nutrients is
      the most common.
    </p>
    <p>
      Primarily, soil tests report on the content of nitrogen (N),
      phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), which are the most important
      nutrients for crops. Secondary nutrients to examine are calcium (Ca),
      sulfur (S), and magnesium (Mg). An extended test also includes minor
      elements like iron (Fe), manganese (Mg), boron (B), molybdenum (Mo),
      and others.
    </p>
    <p>
      To test soil nutrient content, a sample is added to an extractant
      solution and mixed (typically by shaking). Then, the liquid content is
      filtered and analyzed for chemical elements’ presence and
      concentrations (converted to dry matter). The obtained number is the
      soil-test index.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why is it important to test soil for nutrient levels? Availability of
      correct amounts of nutrients at certain phenological stages is vital
      for plants. A nutrient imbalance like nitrogen deficiency severely
      impedes plant growth, while high concentrations cause plant wilting,
      fertilizer burns, or abnormal development.
    </p>

    <h2>Soil Acidity Test (pH)</h2>
    <p>
      Proper pH in the field is essential for plant productivity, and either
      too high or too low pH will adversely affect crop growth. Testing pH
      of soil, one calculates its hydrogen ions. pH values may range from 0
      to 14. The neutral value is 7, lower levels are for acidity, and
      higher than 7 mean alkalinities. Acidic or alkaline fields are treated
      correspondingly. For example, pH can be raised with lime, and an
      accurate pH test helps determine its required quantity.
    </p>
    <p>
      How to test pH level in soil? Various kits allow measuring pH right in
      the field, but more accurate results are provided by state or private
      laboratories.
    </p>

    <h2>Soil Salinity Test</h2>
    <p>
      In saline fields, plants suffer from osmotic stresses due to poor
      water absorption. Soil salinity testing helps understand the
      suitability of lands for agricultural activities. Field salinity can
      be analyzed through:
    </p>
    <ul class="lists">
      <li>
        evaporation of total soluble salts (TSS) from the ground-water
        extract;
      </li>
      <li>
        measuring the electric conductivity (EC) of a saturated paste
        extract or a distilled water-earth dilution.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      An electric conductivity soil test is performed in the field or a
      designated laboratory.
    </p>
    <p>
      An EC soil test can also show the quantity of crop-available nitrogen
      in some non-saline lands.
    </p>
    <h2>Physical Soil Testing For Texture And Structure</h2>
    <p>
      Apart from the chemical content, agricultural soil testing also
      analyzes the soil type and its physical properties like texture,
      structure, and moisture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main components are clay, sand, and silt, and their proportions
      define the ground texture and its ability to retain nutrients with
      moisture. For example, sandy fields dry faster than clay ones, so a
      soil texture test helps in precision irrigation and fertigation
      planning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soil structure describes the size of its parts and pore spaces, which
      affect the flow of water and air in the earth. Clay fields are finer,
      and their pore spaces are small. Therefore, they are prone to
      compaction and require regular aeration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soil type tests also assist in determining crop type suitability.
      Thus, water-loving plants are suitable for clay fields, while
      drought-tolerant species are good for dry sandy ones.
    </p>

    <h2>Soil Moisture Testing</h2>
    <p>
      Water is essential for plant growth, and vegetation cannot develop
      properly under a lack of ground moisture. When the field’s surface is
      dry, it can be noticed visually; yet accurate water rates are measured
      with soil moisture sensors or in the laboratory. A soil moisture
      content test reports water availability for plants or their
      dehydration. High-temperature moisture evaporation from
    </p>

    <h2>How To Get The Soil Tested?</h2>
    <p>
      Deciding on how to conduct a soil test, you can choose any options:
    </p>
    <ul class="lists">
      <li>Do it yourself with special kits.</li>
      <li>
        Send samples for a professional analysis to a state or private
        laboratory. Soil test procedures in some local labs are free.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hire a company that will cover the whole process from sampling to
        field amelioration recommendations.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Regular soil testing is essential for maintaining soil health and
      optimizing crop productivity. By understanding the various types of
      soil tests and their importance, farmers and agricultural
      professionals can make informed decisions to improve soil fertility
      and crop yields.
